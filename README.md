# Gift Box
An ASP.Net MVC project, written as part of the Telerik Software Academy education.

### The idea
Gift Box is an initiative for institutions taking care of homeless children. Our main goal is to allow the community to help by donating gifts and fulfilling other needs a home may have.

### How it works

- Institution Representatives

If you're a homeless institution representative, register your home. After an approvement from the administration, post all the needs the home has. Include all the gifts the children
in your home need for occasions like birthdays or Christmas. 

- Community

If you're a person, willing to take part in the initiative, browse through all the posted needs and either donate a gift or help with one of the other needs o the institution.
